    "bio": "My name is Triet Truong and I am currently taking GA full-time to enhance my knowledge about fullstack development. I have been passionate about coding since I studied Pascal in grade 8th. Then I took computer science grade 11th and 12th classes at high school in Toronto, Canada. My performance at school went well so that I was honored to receive chemical engineering offer from University of Waterloo. Because I had to immigrate to the U.S.A in September, 2022 with my family, I could not have gone there to study. Problem-solving and logic of coding thrills me to explore more about the world of coding. "
